- modified file edit window, added html and Ace editors
- changed apache config rules to allow loading of created images on preview generation
- ace editor has been included in libx folder
    made changes into apache config file to allow access to editor files

- files configuration changes:
    "webdav_files" moved to files.edit.webdav
    we have also "webdav_url", "max_files_version_count"

    Oleg suggested this config
    "edit_files":
        {â€œtxtâ€: â€œtxt, php, js, xml, csvâ€œ,
          â€œhtmlâ€: â€œhtml, htmâ€,
          â€œwebdavâ€: â€œdoc, ppt, docx, odtâ€
        }

    I propose to merge all files related options into one config for them:
    "files": {
        "max_versions": <string or object>
            // string example : *:1;doc,docx,xls,xlsx,pdf:5;png,gif,jpg,jpeg,tif,tiff:2;
            // object example: {
            //   "*": 1
            //   ,"doc,docx,xls,xlsx,pdf": 5
            //   ,"png,gif,jpg,jpeg,tif,tiff": 2
            // }
        ,"edit": { //type: "comma separated extensions string or an array of strings"
            "text": "txt,php,js,xml,csv"
            ,"html": "html,htm"
            ,"webdav": "doc,docx,ppt,dot,dotx,xls,xlsm,xltx,ppt,pot,pps,pptx,odt,ott,odm,ods,odg,otg,odp,odf,odb"
        }
        ,"webdav_url": "https://..."
    }

    There could be general config for files in casebox.config table
    and some properties (of "files") could be overwriten in core config table.

    Added backward compatibility checks so that old configs still work.

CaseBox 1.9.218 (2014-06-15)
==============================
New Features, Improvements

        ,"pass": "emailpassword"
        ,"host": "mail.server.com"
        ,"port": 143
        ,"ssl": true
        ,"common": true
    }

    "common" make sense in global config and if it's set to true then
    this email will be used for every defined core (cores will not be analized for comments email configuration).

                    ,"retention_days": 30
                }

        Note: befre start process through 4_steps_core_upgrade.php you should check the following:
                - if templates fields have names, if not then set names for fields that will result in a duplicate name from l1 field
                - check template names and better set a name for empty names (names should be unique)
                - check title_template field from templates, replace field ids with field names
                - please make sure after core updgrades that templates do have correct sistem folders specified in config.

        This implied refactoring of other units (lib/DB.php, Config.php, etc.)
        Now the main config.ini file should contain a db_user and db_pass for connection to casebox database.
        Configuration for cores is stored in casebox.cores table and could be absolutely different
                from casebox db config (basic config from config.ini).
        Example of core configuration:
                {
                        "core_dir": "//cores/test/"
                        ,"db_host": "localhost"

                                    "update"
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                        ,"includeDefaultPlugins": true
                        ,"plugins": {
                            "Search": {
                                "api": {
                                    "test_SearchRouter": {
                                        "methods": {
                                            "search": {"len": 1}
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                                ,"remote": {
                                    "handler": "test_SearchRouter.search"
                                }
                            }
                        }
                }

        transform_objects_old_data.php - transform objects old data format into new json format and save into data field.
        template_fields_cfg_sync.php - sync of config fields properties from templates_structure table with field objects stored in tree.

Fixed Bugs:
----------

                for templates migration to new model.
                Firstly the database difference update should be applied.
        - upgrade and migration process have been tested on all cores from devel

        Note: Old interface is not removed until the new method is fully tested and functional

        UsersGroups.updateUserEmails
        VerticalEditGrid.addFormData
        Objects.getObjectIcon

        old_id
        pid
        template_id
        is_active
        author
        details
        files_count
- removed acl_count column from tree table. This column were moved previously to tree_info.
        in short future also will be deleted following columns from tree:
                old_id - if necesar then will use another table for imports/associations
                type -
                subtype - we moved to templates mechanism
                is_main - it's used for root folder only

                                Also custom code should be reviewed to make changes if necesary.
- Moved Template.php class to CB\Objects and changed as inherited from Object
- added a config function getOption($optionName)
        this function is designed to be used in all cases and excep direct
        accessing of configuration variables/constants.

                user config
                core config
                platform config
- added config parameters:
        session.lifetime
        session.persistent

        This params are defined in CaseBox platform (see config_sample.ini)
        and can be overwriten by (importance low to high):
                core config.ini
                core database config
                user config
- Security issue: sessions must be destroyed when users password is changed

        D&D is implemented by using plugins mechanism
        D&D execution will generate common event 'objectsaction' for any component to listen to them
        Server side actions for D&D are recursive (CB\Browser\Actions.php)
        Everything works in concordance with security, but there are some moments to discuss

        There are some problems with D&D on a field of Properties grid in Objects edit window.  Still working on it.
        In future will be added more required/request drop zones
