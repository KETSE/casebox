        The main idea is to crate a User class derived from \CB\Objects\Object

--------------------------

- Fix PopupMenu in Tree
- modified file edit window, added html and Ace editors
- changed apache config rules to allow loading of created images on preview generation
- ace editor has been included in libx folder
    made changes into apache config file to allow access to editor files

- files configuration changes:
    "webdav_files" moved to files.edit.webdav
    we have also "webdav_url", "max_files_version_count"

    Oleg suggested this config
    "edit_files":
        {“txt”: “txt, php, js, xml, csv“,
          “html”: “html, htm”,
          “webdav”: “doc, ppt, docx, odt”
        }

    I propose to merge all files related options into one config for them:
    "files": {
        "max_versions": <string or object>
            // string example : *:1;doc,docx,xls,xlsx,pdf:5;png,gif,jpg,jpeg,tif,tiff:2;
            // object example: {
            //   "*": 1
            //   ,"doc,docx,xls,xlsx,pdf": 5
            //   ,"png,gif,jpg,jpeg,tif,tiff": 2
            // }
        ,"edit": { //type: "comma separated extensions string or an array of strings"
            "text": "txt,php,js,xml,csv"
            ,"html": "html,htm"
            ,"webdav": "doc,docx,ppt,dot,dotx,xls,xlsm,xltx,ppt,pot,pps,pptx,odt,ott,odm,ods,odg,otg,odp,odf,odb"
        }
        ,"webdav_url": "https://..."
    }

    There could be general config for files in casebox.config table
    and some properties (of "files") could be overwriten in core config table.

    Added backward compatibility checks so that old configs still work.

CaseBox 1.9.218 (2014-06-15)
==============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------

    config for comments should pe added per core or in casebox.config table.
    Example:
    comments_config:
    {
        "email": "comments.email@server.com"
        ,"pass": "emailpassword"
        ,"host": "mail.server.com"
        ,"port": 143
        ,"ssl": true
        ,"common": true
    }

    "common" make sense in global config and if it's set to true then
    this email will be used for every defined core (cores will not be analized for comments email configuration).

                    ,"retention_days": 30
                }
                // "host" and "port" params are optional, defaults used if not specified

        - for ActionLog virtual folder to be available, add to config.treeNodes:
                "ActionLog":{

        Also casebox plugins are loaded/executed according to their order field value.

CaseBox 1.9.70 (2013-12-09)
==============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- removed all fields from objects and let only id, data, sys_data
- moved automatic names generation for objects in a separate AutoSetFields plugin
- removed old_id fields from database
        Old ids should be keeped in special tables if needed or in sys_data of the object.
- remove private_for_user functionality from casebox
        This feature will be implemented later as a separated casebox plugin.

Fixed Bugs:
----------
- Task responsible peson names missing from preview/notifications

Notes:
----------
- update casebox database from casebox.sql (backup your current cores configuration)
- apply database update for core: 20131209_2328 db_update v1.9.70.sql

CaseBox 1.9.69 (2013-12-05)
==============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- system folders mechanism has been moved to a casebox plugin.
        The essence of the plugin is to copy a structure, specified in the config of the created object template, to the created object.

- adjustments for core upgrade process
        Note: befre start process through 4_steps_core_upgrade.php you should check the following:
                - if templates fields have names, if not then set names for fields that will result in a duplicate name from l1 field
                - check template names and better set a name for empty names (names should be unique)
                - check title_template field from templates, replace field ids with field names
                - please make sure after core updgrades that templates do have correct sistem folders specified in config.

CaseBox 1.9.68 (2013-12-04)
==============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- export results plugin. For now espors into html format as a table.
- changed Objects.copy method to work as loading source object and save as a new target object.
        We'll see if this method work without problems and will delete methods designed for copy.
- added ID in properties panel of the object edit window
- changed task categories to be displayed from tree
        param names that could be set in config table of the core are:
                task_categories: <id of the tags folder from tree>
                default_task_category: <default value id>
- changed DisplayColumns plugin config so it can load columns data differently for active language.

Fixed Bugs:
----------
- sorting objects by id did not work
- names with special chars did not show correctly on editing in grid
- objects date not updated accordingly to internal object properties.
- objects with createMethod = inline did not automatically appear in tree or browser in edit mode after clicking create.
        This mostly refers to folders creation.
- grid editor for name collumn was destroyed because of DisplayColumns plugin. It reconfigures column structure.

CaseBox 1.9.67 (2013-11-30)
==============================
Fixed Bugs:
----------

CaseBox 1.9.63 (2013-11-28)
==============================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- improved plugins configuration structure and loading
- updated class Browser\CreateMenu
- refactored scripts for templates and tags synchronization into tree.
- modified DisplayColumns plugin to read it's config from search templates on templated search
- added CB_Browser_SearchRouter standard casebox class for templated searches
- added Search plugin for templated searches
- moved core configs into database (casebox.cores) as a json formated field
        This implied refactoring of other units (lib/DB.php, Config.php, etc.)
        Now the main config.ini file should contain a db_user and db_pass for connection to casebox database.
        Configuration for cores is stored in casebox.cores table and could be absolutely different
                from casebox db config (basic config from config.ini).
        Example of core configuration:
                {
                        "core_dir": "//cores/test/"
                        ,"db_host": "localhost"
                        ,"db_name": "cb_hcav"
                        ,"db_user": "username"
                        ,"db_pass": "password"
                        ,"db_port": 3306
                        ,"listeners": {
                            "beforeNodeSolrUpdate": {
                                "test\\Search": [
                                    "update"
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                        ,"includeDefaultPlugins": true
                        ,"plugins": {
                            "Search": {
                                "api": {
                                    "test_SearchRouter": {
                                        "methods": {
                                            "search": {"len": 1}
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                                ,"remote": {
                                    "handler": "test_SearchRouter.search"
                                }
                            }
                        }
                }

- renamed constants:
        CORE_ROOT -> CORE_DIR
        APP_ROOT -> APP_DIR
        PLUGINS_PATH -> PLUGINS_DIR
        CORENAME -> CORE_NAME

        4_steps_core_upgrade.php - it has a description inside. Please read.
        solr_reindex_document.php - reindex a single document (used for testing)
        transform_objects_old_data.php - transform objects old data format into new json format and save into data field.
        template_fields_cfg_sync.php - sync of config fields properties from templates_structure table with field objects stored in tree.

Fixed Bugs:
----------

                type -
                subtype - we moved to templates mechanism
                is_main - it's used for root folder only

        Everything works in concordance with security, but there are some moments to discuss

        There are some problems with D&D on a field of Properties grid in Objects edit window.  Still working on it.
        In future will be added more required/request drop zones
