    Now the main config.ini file should contain a db_user and db_pass for connection to casebox database.
    Configuration for cores is stored in casebox.cores table and could be absolutely different
        from casebox db config (basic config from config.ini).
    Example of core configuration:
        {
            "core_dir": "//cores/test/"
            ,"db_host": "localhost"
            ,"db_name": "cb_hcav"
            ,"db_user": "username"
            ,"db_pass": "password"
            ,"db_port": 3306
            ,"listeners": {
              "beforeNodeSolrUpdate": {
                "test\\Search": [
                  "update"
                ]
              }
            }
            ,"includeDefaultPlugins": true
            ,"plugins": {
              "Search": {
                "api": {
                  "test_SearchRouter": {
                    "methods": {
                      "search": {"len": 1}
                    }
                  }
                }
                ,"remote": {
                  "handler": "test_SearchRouter.search"
                }
              }
            }
        }

- renamed constants:
    CORE_ROOT -> CORE_DIR
    APP_ROOT -> APP_DIR
    PLUGINS_PATH -> PLUGINS_DIR
    CORENAME -> CORE_NAME

    4_steps_core_upgrade.php - it has a description inside. Please read.
    solr_reindex_document.php - reindex a single document (used for testing)
    transform_objects_old_data.php - transform objects old data format into new json format and save into data field.

Fixed Bugs:
----------
- other small bugfixes
- TemplateField class did not correctly detect it's parent template
- wrong reference to $config variable
- check for array param received in DisplayColumns plugin

Notes:
----------
- update casebox database from casebox.sql

    Other cripts are transferred to destination folders where will be refactored to use described scheme.

- encoded html chars for rendering textual values in Vertical grid
- Templates management in tree
    - script casebox/sys/utils/create_templates_in_tree.php has been created
        for templates migration to new model.
        Firstly the database difference update should be applied.
    - upgrade and migration process have been tested on all cores from devel

    Note: Old interface is not removed until the new method is fully tested and functional

- added new template types: field, search
- removed methods:
    UsersGroups.updateUserEmails
    VerticalEditGrid.addFormData
    Objects.getObjectIcon

- Changed usage of fetch_row for fetch_assoc everywhere in CaseBox
- moved methods:
    Util\getUsername -> User::getDisplayName
    Files::getAutoRenameFilename -> Objects::getAvailableName
- removed following columns from objects table:
    old_id
    pid
    template_id
    is_active
    author
    details
    files_count

    in short future also will be deleted following columns from tree:
        old_id - if necesar then will use another table for imports/associations
        type -
        subtype - we moved to templates mechanism
        is_main - it's used for root folder only
- changed everywhere json_decode to return associative arrays instead of objects
    REMEMBER! : we will not use objects (like BogusAction from router).
                All params will be associative array. No more objects.
                Also custom code should be reviewed to make changes if necesary.
- Moved Template.php class to CB\Objects and changed as inherited from Object
- added a config function getOption($optionName)
    this function is designed to be used in all cases and excep direct
    accessing of configuration variables/constants.
    It uses the priority to return requested param from available configs:
        user config
        core config
        platform config
- added config parameters:
    session.lifetime
    session.persistent

    This params are defined in CaseBox platform (see config_sample.ini)
    and can be overwriten by (importance low to high):
        core config.ini
        core database config
        user config
- Security issue: sessions must be destroyed when users password is changed

    D&D is implemented by using plugins mechanism
    D&D execution will generate common event 'objectsaction' for any component to listen to them
    Server side actions for D&D are recursive (CB\Browser\Actions.php)
    Everything works in concordance with security, but there are some moments to discuss

    There are some problems with D&D on a field of Properties grid in Objects edit window.  Still working on it.
