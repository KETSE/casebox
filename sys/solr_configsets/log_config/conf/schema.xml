 This is the Solr schema file. This file should be named "schema.xml" and
 should be in the conf directory under the solr home
 (i.e. ./solr/conf/schema.xml by default)
 or located where the classloader for the Solr webapp can find it.

 This example schema is the recommended starting point for users.
 It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box.

 For more information, on how to customize this file, please see
 http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml

 PERFORMANCE NOTE: this schema includes many optional features and should not
 be used for benchmarking.  To improve performance one could
	- set stored="false" for all fields possible (esp large fields) when you
		only need to search on the field but don't need to return the original
		value.
	- set indexed="false" if you don't need to search on the field, but only
		return the field as a result of searching on other indexed fields.
	- remove all unneeded copyField statements
	- for best index size and searching performance, set "index" to false
		for all general text fields, use copyField to copy them to the
		catchall "text" field, and use that for searching.
	- For maximum indexing performance, use the StreamingUpdateSolrServer
		java client.
	- Remember to run the JVM in server mode, and use a higher logging level
		that avoids logging every request
