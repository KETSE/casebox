Casebox
======================================================

Casebox is a Content Management Platform for record, file and task management.

Casebox was developed jointly by HURIDOCS and KETSE.com.

Starting in 2017, HURIDOCS manages its own version of the Casebox codebase for human rights organisations and KETSE.com continues to support the original code. 

If you are working with a human rights organisation, contact casebox at huridocs.org

If your request is not related to human rights work and you are not a non-profit, then please contact Ketse at info at ketse.com for more information on the commercial services they can provide.
